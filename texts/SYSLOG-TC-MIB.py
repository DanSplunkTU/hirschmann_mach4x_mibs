For interoperability and backwards-\n         compatibility reasons, this document specifies a\n         normative mapping between a label, which represents a\n         Facility, and the corresponding numeric value.  This label\n         could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager user\n         interfaces.\n\n         The label itself is often semantically meaningless\n         because it is impractical to attempt to enumerate all\n         possible Facilities, and many daemons and processes do\n         not have an explicitly assigned Facility code or label.\n         For example, there is no Facility label corresponding to\n         an HTTP service.  An HTTP service implementation might log\n         messages as coming from, for example, 'local7' or 'uucp'.\n         This is typical current practice, and originators, relays,\n         and collectors can be configured to properly handle this\n         situation.  For improved accuracy, an application can also\n         include an APP-NAME structured data element.\n\n         Note that operating system mechanisms for configuring\n         syslog, such as syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized\n         and might use different sets of Facility labels and/or\n         mapping between Facility labels and Facility codes than the\n         MIB.\n\n         In particular, the labels corresponding to Facility codes 4,\n         10, 13, and 14, and the code corresponding to the Facility\n         label 'cron' are known to vary across different operating\n         systems.  To distinguish between the labels corresponding\n         to Facility codes 9 and 15, a label of 'cron2' is assigned\n         to the Facility code 15.  This list is not intended to be\n         exhaustive; other differences might exist, and new\n         differences might be introduced in the future.\n\n         The mapping specified here MUST be used in a MIB network\n         management interface, even though a particular syslog\n         implementation might use a different mapping in a\n         different network management interface.\n        "
